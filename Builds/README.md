#Builds

There are two different folders; Common and Debug.
The Common folder contains working released/unreleased builds.
The Debug folder contains all builds; which are mostly test builds.
They're not in .7z or .zip files though, unlike builds in the common folder.

##Common Builds: 

**The Build Archives are .7z files; older ones are Password Protected for Security Purposes. The Password is "d2fd34". Let me know if you don't like this change.
This helps to prevent Anti-Virus Software from scanning the Archive, and removing it. Even though it contains nothing Malicious.

The newer archives are no longer password protected; but older builds have the password "d2fd34" without quotes.**

##Debug Builds: 

These builds aren't archived, yet you can still download the .exe file(s). 
Do remember that these builds are most likely unstable and are for testing; 
and aren't intended for normal use.
