#Builds

There are two different folders; Common and Debug.
The Common folder contains working released/unreleased builds.
The Debug folder contains all builds; which are mostly test builds.
They're not in .7z or .zip files though, unlike builds in the common folder.

##Common Builds: 

The common build .7z files are password protected. This is to prevent Anti-Virus 
software from scanning the archive. Not because there's any virus' or malware; but,
due to most Anti-Virus software suites recognizing some software as such. 

The newer archives are no longer password protected; but older builds have the password "d2fd34" without quotes. 

##Debug Builds: 

These builds aren't archived, yet you can still download the .exe file(s). 
Do remember that these builds are most likely unstable and are for testing; 
and aren't intended for normal use.
