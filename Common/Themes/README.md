#Themes

The following files and folders are for SimpliiU.
They contain audio and image files.

These files (audio) are from their original creators; I take no credit
whatsoever! 

They're as follows: 

* Ryuko Matoi Theme 
* Satsuki Theme 
* Uzu Theme 
* Aikuro Theme 
* Nonon Theme 
* Ragyo Theme 

**NOTE:** as of 0.8.0 Beta, the Theme parser is **NOT** finished! 
By at least 0.8.2 or 0.9.0, the theme parser will be completed; as well
as the Updater and RedNAND Setup.

##Credits:

* Studio Trigger: for their great work on Kill la Kill, thanks so much for a great Anime show.
If you haven't watched Kill la Kill, please do; It's such a great anime! 
* All my fellow Tempers: For supporting me this far, and with other projects! I'm so glad that 
people find my Projects so useful, and I hope to create other useful programs and homebrew in the future!

make Wii U hacking possible!
