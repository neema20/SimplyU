##Changelog: 

**The Build Archives are .7z files; older ones are Password Protected for Security Purposes. The Password is "d2fd34". Let me know if you don't like this change.
This helps to prevent Anti-Virus Software from scanning the Archive, and removing it. Even though it contains nothing Malicious.

Newer ones are no longer Password protected.**


###Release 1.0.2: 
* Fixed some minor issues
* Working on other features (Download code, RedNand Setup, etc.) 
* Refining the updater code
* Refining the Theme Management (Will have a better layout and design for choosing themes; as well as a fallback mode if a theme doesn't exist, that was applied.) 
* Added error forms, for when an Error occurs; the Application will halt, and return to said form rather than crashing.

**NOTE:** This build is a development build, it is **NOT** to be used for normal use. Please report any issues or bugs that you may encounter. To do that, go to the "Issues" tab and report it. 

###Release 1.0.0: 
* Fixed some minor bugs with the Updater
* Refined the code, and working on adding more homebrew options 
* Improved perfomance and stability 

###Release 0.9.1 
* SimpliiU Now has a working Updater (Using a similar method as 3DNUS. This allows you to get updates more often, and rather easily. For example, you can get Revision Updates: 0.9.1.1 for example.) 
* Fixed some minor bugs
* Still adding some more options 

**NOTE:** NOT ALL THE HOMEBREW IN THE PREPARE FORM ARE WORKING! Meaning that they won't download, due to the download code still being added. Should be finished by 1.0.0! 

###Release 0.9.0: 
**NOTE:** This is a Nightly, and is not Intended for normal use. Do proceed with caution! 
* Working on the new Layout 
* Added more homebrew options 
* The new layout now separates homebrew by their category. 

###Release 0.8.1:
* Fixed some minor issues 
* Added the full ability of setting a custom theme.
The themes are stored within the \Common\Themes folder in your SimpliiU 
directory. That folder contains other folders, which are the names of the themes 
you have. Inside a theme folder is two folders, "img" and "audio." Inside the img folder there 
should be a "pnl_back.png" file as well as "SimplyU_Full_Logo.png." The .xcf files are on Github, inside of \Common\Resources\Images. You can easily edit those .xcf's and make your own theme. Inside of the audio folder, there should be a file called "audio_bck.mp3;" don't worry, the music replays perfectly now. The application comes with the following themes pre-installed: "Default, Ryuko, Satsuki, Rock Edition, Sonic, and RWBY."
Inside the root of a theme's folder, there should be a color.ini file. This file will contain the word for the color scheme. Read the README.md for more info (In the themes directory. \master\Common\Themes\README.md) 

* Still working on redNAND Setup as well as the Updater. 

###Release 0.8.0:
* Fixed some minor bugs
* Music now Repeats perfectly; thus the timer method is no longer used. 
* Now SimpliiU has a new Theme management, which is parsed using INI files. This includes that possibility of adding any custom theme, and background music. But, It's not finished. Although, this update includes a Satsuki theme from Kill la Kill.
